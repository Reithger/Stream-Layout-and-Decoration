# Stream-Layout-Decorations
 Repository of the code I've written for stream effects, either decorative or for visual formatting purposes

 These are typically intended to be run via the local-file Browser Source option in OBS (point it at the HTML file with the .js file in the same repo) and should infer their own size from the OBS element to format appropriately.

 Border.html needs a way to specify behavior externally to hot-swap between visual options without having to edit the source file.
